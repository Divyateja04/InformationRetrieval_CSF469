To resolve import errors in Java

Go to the explorer option on vscode (top left corner when you open project folder) and select Java Projects
You will see a Java Projects drop down in the same window below your project folder
Over there you will see a folder called Referenced Libraries
Click on + and add all the jar files from the attached zip folder
It should work now

For python just do pip install py4j
